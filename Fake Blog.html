    <h1>Welcome to my Veronica Mars blog</h1>
    <p>Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) is about a spunky High School-aged teen who was shunned by her friends after her best friend Lily was murdered and her dad (the County Sheriff) suspected the town's most prominent family for the murder. After her dad was outsted as Sheriff by the town, she began working for him in his detective agency: Mars Investigations.</p>
    <p>After solving Lily's murder, more mysteries happen keeping Veronica busy with work with her dad, her love life (which gets complicated), and finishing High School. </p>
    <p>After three seasons, Veronica Mars was cancelled. All seemed lost. Kickstarter was able to revive the franchise for a fan-backed movie and the creator, Rob Thomas, wrote a couple books leaving off where the movie ended.</p>
    <p>Is this the end of Veronica Mars? Time will only tell but it will always live on for me - and there are always talks between Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell about doing something to bring her back in some form. That means there is hope!</p>
    <p>There are so many platforms she could return:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>TV</li>
            <li>Netflix</li>
            <li>Hulu</li>
            <li>Amazon</li>
            <li>YouTube</li>
            <li>Movies</li>
        </ul>
